The first press on the screen generates a level. The next press on any tile will reveal how many bombs surround said tile. Press a tile with a bomb and you lose.
Left mouse button -> reveal a tile
Right mouse button -> flag a tile 


Notes: I don't think I will be finishing the game, so you won't be able to lose and the level won't reveal some tile's numbers on generation.
